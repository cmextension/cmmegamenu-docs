Overview
========

CM Mega Menu is a set of a component (com_cmmegamenu) and a module (mod_cmmegamenu), the component helps you setup a menu and the module helps you display the menu.

CM Mega Menu uses YAMM (Yet another megamenu) which extends Bootstrap's navigation bar to create mega menu.

You can find demo of YAMM with Bootstrap 2 `here <http://geedmo.github.io/yamm>`_ and Bootstrap 3 `here <http://geedmo.github.io/yamm3/>`_.

Because Joomla! Menu Manager can't be used to setup the menu, CM Mega Menu component is built to do this task.

With CM Mega Menu you can do most of what YAMM supports, like section, accordions, pictures,... By combining with other Joomla! extensions you can do whatever you want as long as those extensions support, from display a login form, a contact form, to display videos,...
